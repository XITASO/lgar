    "title": "Development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with intermediate hyperglycaemia",
    "inclusion_criteria": "- Study design: Prospective cohort studies investigating either the overall prognosis of people with IH for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or intermediate hyperglycaemia (IH) versus normoglycaemia as a prognostic factor for developing T2DM\n- Types of participants: cohort studies in people with IH at baseline, defined by impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these. To study whether IH compared to normoglycaemia is a prognostic factor for developing T2DM, we include cohort studies in people with IH and normoglycaemia at baseline.\n- Types of outcome measures: outcome of primary interest is the diagnosis of newly developed T2DM (T2DM incidence). T2DM incidence should have been diagnosed by blood glucose measurements such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), two-hour postload glucose (PG) or HbA1c.",
    "exclusion_criteria": "- Intervention trials and study designs other than prospective cohort studies\n- People with comorbidities at baseline (e.g. people with coronary heart disease and IGT)\n- Missing data on transition from IH to T2DM\n- Follow-up period after baseline assessment not specified (not possible to associate T2DM incidence with length of follow-up)\n- T2DM incidence evaluated by documents (e.g. hospital records, retrospective use of registers) or self-report only",
    "research_questions": "- If people have intermediate hyperglycaemia (IH) at baseline, how many individuals develop type 2 diabetes in the future?\n- How does glycaemic status (intermediate hyperglycaemia compared with normoglycaemia) at baseline affect the development of type 2 diabetes?",
    "objectives": "- To assess the overall prognosis of people with IH for the development of T2DM and to assess how many people with IH revert back to normoglycaemia (regression. \n- To assess the difference in T2DM incidence in people with IH versus people with normoglycaemia.",
